tunnel info is at: tunnelbroker.net
with these login creds: jagagne/P1ngP0ng
bridge/gif0 config script is in /usr/local/bin
and startup script at: /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.myipv6script.plist

load/unload w/:

sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.myipv6script.plist


Also, DNS6 will only work in mavericks if the v6 conifgs are available via the nnetworks preferences. the tunnel (gif0) doesn't actually use these preferences, so you need to update the v6 address manually in preferences.
